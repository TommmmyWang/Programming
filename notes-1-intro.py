# Create our own Chatbot

# 1. Greet the user with a predetermined statement
greet = "Hello! I am a Chatbot!"

# 2. Print the statement
print(greet)

print("My name is IRN.")
print("I'm not like the other chatbots.")
print("I'm completely deterministic.")
print("Other chatbots can generate content, I can only follow pre-existing codes!")

# 3. Wow the user with some math
print("I bet you don't know what 8*8 is.")
print("I can do it.")
print(f"8*8 is actually {8 * 8}.")
print("What is pi squared?")
print("I'm smart and can do it.")
print(f"it is {3.1415927 * 3.1415927}")

# 4. Get the name of the user and store it
user_name = input("So... what's your name?")
print(f"It's nice to meet you, {user_name}.")

# 5. Ask the user three questions
print(f"I want to know more about you,{user_name}")
fav_food = input("What is your favorite food?")
print(f"Wow, {fav_food}, yummy!")
fav_color = input("What is your favorite color?")
print(f"Good, I like the color {fav_color} too!")
fav_movie = input("What is your favorite movie?")
print(f"{fav_movie}, what an classic!")

# 6. Say goodbye using the user's name
print(f"What a fun time chatting with you, {user_name}!")
print("I can't believe it's already time to say goodbye.")
print(f"Let's chat in the future again, {user_name}!")
print("See you later!")
